# NodeJS Application with Stripe Payments
The aim of this project was to practice implementing Stripe API was well as practice NodeJS

### Process
This application was created following a basic tutorial on implementing the Stripe API and accepting Stripe Tokens and test payments.

The tutorial used handlebars as the view engine.

### Future
I am going to try and allow the application to accept payments for more than one product and securely download the product after the Stripe Token has been accepted and payment has completed.
